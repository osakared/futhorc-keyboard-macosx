Want to type unicode runes on your Mac? Look no further! Simply copy the `.layout` and `.icns` files to your Keyboard Layouts folder. If you aren't able to view runes (the above looks like gibberish or boxes), then you'll need a font that covers runes [like some of the fonts here](http://www.personal.psu.edu/ejp10/blogs/gotunicode/charts/runes.html). There's also [code2000](http://www.fontspace.com/james-kass/code2000), which set out to cover the whole extended unicode range.

    git clone https://github.com/osakared/futhorc-keyboard-macosx.git
    cd futhorc-keyboard-macosx
    mkdir -p ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/
    cp Futhorc.* ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
